            content="Indian Motorcycles, a prominent player in the American two-wheeler market, has just announced its latest limited edition model – the FTR X 100% R Carbon. Unveiled at the EICMA 2023, this new offering is set to redefine the biking experience. Here's an in-depth look at what makes it stand out.&nbsp;Striking Looks in Blue Candy Carbon Fiber&nbsp;At first glance, the FTR X 100% R Carbon shares a visual resemblance with the stock FTR R Carbon. However, upon a much closer look, there seem to be major upgrades. The bodywork is elegantly draped in carbon fiber in a mesmerizing Blue Candy hue.&nbsp;Noteworthy components like the headlight bezel, fuel tank, pillion seat cowl, and front fender boast this carbon finish, accentuated by contrasting white paint on the chassis.&nbsp;Red accents on the bottom panel, the iconic Indian logo on the fuel tank, and red detailing on the wheels contribute to the overall visual spectacle.&nbsp;Adding an extra layer of uniqueness, the motorcycle cruises on unconventional blacked-out Ohlins front forks with striking golden tubes, while the exhaust pipes and canister tips receive the same distinctive treatment.&nbsp;Engine Specifications&nbsp;Beyond its captivating looks, the FTR X 100% R Carbon retains the formidable engine of its standard counterpart. Powered by a 1,203cc, twin-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine, it generates an impressive 121 bhp and 117 Nm.&nbsp;The braking system is equally top-notch, featuring Brembo brakes on both ends. It comes equipped with 17-inch cast wheels wrapped in 120/70 front and 180/55 rear Metzeler tyres.&nbsp;Cutting-Edge Features&nbsp;&nbsp;This limited edition model is not just about looks &amp; power; it packs a technological punch. The FTR X 100% R Carbon boasts a 4-inch TFT screen with smartphone connectivity. Riders can choose from multiple modes – rain, standard, sport – while enjoying the benefits of -&nbsp;Lean Angle-Sensitive ABS,&nbsp;Stability Control,&nbsp;Traction Control,&nbsp;Wheelie &amp; Rear Lift Mitigation,&nbsp;A USB charge Port, and&nbsp;Cruise Control.&nbsp;Limited to Only 400 Units!&nbsp;Indian Motorcycles plans to manufacture only 400 units of the FTR X 100% R Carbon. Out of which, a mere 150 units are allocated for the American market, while the remaining 250 are for other global markets.
